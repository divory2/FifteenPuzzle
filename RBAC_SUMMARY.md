### 🔵 Guest Role
**Limited access:**

- ❌ Cannot upload images
- ❌ Cannot access any admin features

## Implementation Details

### Frontend (JavaScript)
- **RBAC.js**: Centralized permission system
- **Automatic UI updates**: Shows/hides elements based on role
- **Button states**: Enables/disables based on permissions
- **CSS classes**: `.admin-only`, `.player-only` for styling

### Backend (PHP)
- **Session validation**: Server-side role checking
- **Database operations**: Role-based data access
- **File uploads**: Permission validation before processing
- **Admin panel**: Restricted to admin role only

### Key Functions
- `RBAC.hasPermission(permission)`: Check if user has specific permission
- `RBAC.executeWithPermission(permission, callback, errorMsg)`: Execute action with permission check
- `RBAC.applyRoleBasedUI()`: Update UI based on current user role

## File Access Control

### game.php
- **Access**: Players and Admins can play and upload images
- **Validation**: Server-side permission checking for uploads
- **UI**: Role-based button visibility

### admin.php
- **Access**: Admins ONLY
- **Redirect**: Non-admins redirected to login
- **Features**: Full administrative control

### index.php
- **Access**: Public with role-based navigation
- **Links**: Different options shown based on user role

## Security Features
1. **Server-side validation**: All critical operations validated on server
2. **Session management**: Proper role storage and validation
3. **Permission inheritance**: Admins inherit all player permissions
4. **Graceful degradation**: Features hidden/disabled for unauthorized users

## Usage Examples

### Check Permission
```javascript
if (RBAC.hasPermission('play_game')) {
    // User can play game
}
```

### Execute with Permission
```javascript
RBAC.executeWithPermission('upload_images', function() {
    // Upload logic here
}, "You need to be a player or admin to upload images");
```

### PHP Role Check
```php
if ($_SESSION['role'] === 'admin') {
    // Admin-only code
} elseif (in_array($_SESSION['role'], ['player', 'admin'])) {
    // Player and admin code
}
```
